CODE: Gather CSS in one file and reference & make scss


PRODUCT IDEA: Add 'Hook' source - so that instead of fetching the data for a source, we create an endpoint on the server side (for example https://easy-dashboard/<username>/hooks/<source> and
 the user should post his data here. Each time he posts the data, the dashboard is 'realtime' updated (probably with sockets).
 
 
PRODUCT IDEA: After the user has customized the dashboard - we offer a 'DOWNLOAD THE CODE OF THIS DASHBOARD' and he downloads the entire code for the configured logic. Then he can host it anywhere (he should either only download the front-end or the back-end I don't know yet....

IDEA: First input the data. It understands what widgets it will show automagically... THEN after it renders you go through the UI and setup the props for each widget.......

IDEA:
Dev visits the github project Open Source Control. 
We describe the "Basic" configuration and prompt him to the documentation site. 
Then we prompt him to the configurator website. 

There he sets up a dashboard with the designer/configurator in some kind of 1 or 2 step wizard and in the end we prompt him to "DOWNLOAD THE CONFIGURATION" OR [!!!] "HOST IT IN OUR SERVICE!!!".
Perhaps there we give him her the first month for free !!!!

IDEA: Setup Notification Rules on a Dashboard..... => Notification Service !!! Probably along with an app that shows the dashboard and sends notifications instead of e-mails... !!!
